                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                powerful way to apply your skills to impactful projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another language, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of contributors collaborating across countries and disciplines, and
                this event specially welcomes beginners to that style
                of collaboration.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                practical skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
